            <h3>About SciLifeLab Serve</h3>
            <p>SciLifeLab Serve is a platform for serving applications and machine learning models that is offered to life science researchers affiliated with a Swedish research institute and their collaborators. Currently, the service is running in beta testing mode. The service is available free of charge to researchers with and without an affiliation to SciLifeLab, to collaborators of these researchers, as well as to data-producing infrastructures in Sweden.</p>
            <h4>Infrastructure behind the service</h4>
            <p>SciLifeLab Serve is developed and maintained by the <a href="https://scilifelab.se/data">SciLifeLab Data Centre</a>. The service is originally based on the open-source platform <a href="https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/stackn">STACKn</a>, developed by <a href="https://github.com/scaleoutsystems">Scaleout systems</a>, a spinoff from the Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University. The most up to date source code and other components that the service is built from are <a href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/stackn/">available with an open source license on GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>SciLifeLab Serve as well as the applications and models deployed through the service are hosted on a <a href="kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes cluster</a> located and administered on hardware at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and managed by the SciLifeLab Data Centre.</p>

            <p>SciLifeLab, Science for Life Laboratory, is an institution for the advancement of molecular biosciences in Sweden. We are funded as a national research infrastructure by the Swedish government. Our organization leverages the unique strengths of individual researchers across Sweden into a focused resource for the life science community. We provide access, via our infrastructure units, for thousands of researchers to the cutting-edge instrumentation and deep scientific expertise necessary to be internationally competitive in bioscience research. Our infrastructure is supported and developed by our research community, including internationally recognised experts in life science and technology. Our facilities and expertise create a unique environment for carrying out health and environmental research at the highest level.</p>
            <p>SciLifeLab started out in 2010 as a joint effort between four universities: Karolinska Institutet, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm University and Uppsala University. Today, we support research activities at all major Swedish universities.</p>

            <h5>SciLifeLab Data Centre</h5>
            <p><a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data/">https://www.scilifelab.se/data/</a></p>
            <p>Life science research is increasingly becoming not only technology-driven, but also data-driven. SciLifeLab coordinates and supports activities throughout the life cycle of data, from project planning, data production, data analysis, data sharing, to publishing and reuse of data, where researchers are dependent on advanced data analysis and e-infrastructures.</p>
            <p>We focus primarily on ensuring that data generated using the SciLifeLab infrastructure platforms is used to promote how data can aid in progressing knowledge, especially when it is made findable and available. At SciLifeLab, we see data as one of the most valuable and long-lasting products of our operations, and strive to make our data FAIR, to ensure that it is handled according to open science standards, and to maximise the long-term value of the data to the scientific community.</p>
