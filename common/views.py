    View for user registration

    This view uses two forms: UserForm and ProfileForm together, and due to that it's a bit complicated.
    See SS-507 for more information.

    From technical perspective, it relies on django calling ``form_valid`` to validate form first.
    If the form is valid, it will save the form and redirect to ``success`` page.

    If the form is invalid, it will call ``custom_form_invalid`` to render the form again with errors.

    But if there are any errors with UserForm it will call ``form_invalid`` first.
