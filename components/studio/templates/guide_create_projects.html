  <h4>Components</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Dashboard</em>:</strong> Overview of the project.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Objects</em>:</strong> Model objects created in the current project.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Compute</em>:</strong> A list of pre-configured data science environments
      for
      experimentation and
      training ML models. (Currently, this tab will only have a pre-installed JupyterLab
      instance available
      for the user. Using this instance, users can e.g. can run experiments and also create
      model objects
      mentioned above. The tutorials below will elaborate on this.)
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Serve</em>:</strong> A list of the most common applications used for
      deploying
      Machine Learning models, as well as options to create R Shiny and Dash apps. All options

      Custom applications can be added to this list, if
      requested.
