  <p>Users are able to host apps and models. Every app and model has to be located within a
    project. Projects that you have created/been granted access to can be found under the <span
      style="font-weight: 500;color: #041c39c7;">Projects</span> tab in the sidebar. </p>
  <h4 id="create-a-project"><span>Creating a project</span></h4>
  <p>Users need to be logged in to create a project. Users can create a new Project by following
    the steps below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on the <span style="font-weight: 500;color: #041c39c7;">Projects</span> tab shown
      on the sidebar (only visible if you are logged in).
    </li>
    <li>Click the <span style="font-weight: 500;color: #041c39c7;">New Project</span> button in
      the top right corner of the window.
    </li>
    <li>Select the project template that you want to use (currently there is only one template
      available).
    </li>
    <li>Enter project name (mandatory) and description (optional).</li>
    <li>Click the <span style="font-weight: 500;color: #041c39c7;">Create Project</span> button
      to create the
      new project.

  <p>This will take you to the project Dashboard. Here, users will be able to see an overview of
    the whole project. Different project component options will now appear as tabs in the
    sidebar. A description of what each project component is can be found below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Dashboard</em>:</strong> Overview of the project.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Objects</em>:</strong> Model objects created in the current project.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Compute</em>:</strong> A list of pre-configured data science environments
      for
      experimentation and
      training ML models. (Currently, this tab will only have a pre-installed JupyterLab
      instance available
      for the user. Using this instance, users can e.g. can run experiments and also create
      model objects
      mentioned above. The tutorials below will elaborate on this.)
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Serve</em>:</strong> A list of the most common applications used for
      deploying
      Machine Learning models, as well as options to create R Shiny and Dash apps. All options
      are available as ‘cards’, and you can use the ‘Create’ button to use these applications.
      Custom applications can be added to this list, if
      requested.
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Settings</em>:</strong> Users can access and change the current project
      settings. Here one can, for example, add other project members.
    </li>
  </ul>

                    <p>The <span style="font-weight: 500;color: #041c39c7;">Settings</span> page contains all the
                        information about
                        your Project and its components. Some of the things you can do there are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Change the Project's description</li>
                        <li>Grant access to the project to registered users.</li>
                        <li>Transfer ownership of the project to another user.</li>
                        <li>Permanently delete the project.</li>
                    </ul> -->
