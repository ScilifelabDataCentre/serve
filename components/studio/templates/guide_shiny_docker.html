  Turning an R Shiny apps into a Docker image

{% block guide-content %}
  <p>As of now, SciLifeLab Serve only allows to host R Shiny applications if they are packaged as Docker images. While
    this is a straightforward process, it can cause difficulties if you have never created a Docker image before. To
    make this easier, the SciLifeLab Serve team is happy to help you with this through a free individual consultation,
    get in touch with us by e-mailing <a href="mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se">datacentre@scilifelab.se</a>.
    Alternatively, we provide step-by-step instructions on how to do it on this page. We do not go in detail explaining
    what each of the tools and settings we use here mean as we try to keep it as simple/short as possible. You can learn
    more about Docker images in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/">official Docker documentation</a>.</p>
  <p>You can find <a href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/shiny-adhd-medication-sweden">the example Shiny app
    used in this tutorial on GitHub</a>.</p>

  
  <h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a> installed on your machine</li>
    <li>An account to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">DockerHub</a></li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Step 1: Create a Dockerfile</h3>
  <p>Docker images are built from sets of instructions given in a so-called <a
    href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">Dockerfile</a>. The name of the file should be exactly
    'Dockerfile' and it should not have any file extension. We created an example Dockerfile to make it easier to start.
    Create a file using any text editor you have and insert the code below or simply <a
      href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/shiny-adhd-medication-sweden/main/Dockerfile">download
      this example from here</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span style="color:#045C64">FROM</span> rocker/shiny:latest

<span style="color:#045C64">RUN</span> apt-get update && \
    apt-get upgrade -y && \
    apt-get clean && \
    apt-get install -y git libxml2-dev libmagick++-dev && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

<span style="color:#045C64">RUN</span> Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("shiny","tidyverse"))'

<span style="color:#045C64">COPY</span> /app/ /srv/shiny-server/app

<span style="color:#045C64">RUN</span> cd /srv/shiny-server/ && \
    sudo chown -R shiny:shiny /srv/shiny-server/app

<span style="color:#045C64">COPY</span> shiny-customized.config /etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf

<span style="color:#045C64">EXPOSE</span> 3838

<span style="color:#045C64">CMD</span> ["R", "-e", "shiny::runApp('/app/', host = '0.0.0.0', port = 3838)"]</code></pre>
  <p>Let us look at how you can customize it for your own app. In this example two packages were installed: <i>shiny</i>
    and <i>tidyverse</i>. This was done with the command
    <pre><code><span style="color:#045C64">CMD</span> ["R", "-e", "shiny::runApp('/app/', host = '0.0.0.0', port = 3838)"]</code></pre>
  Add your own packages here as needed by your app.</p>
  <p>In this example the actual Shiny app code (the file <i>app.R</i>) as well as all dependencies are located in the
    folder called <i>'app'</i>. This folder as a whole is copied into the image using the command
    <pre><code><span style="color:#045C64">COPY</span> /app/ /srv/shiny-server/app</code></pre>
    Change the folder names in this line and lines below if you have your own folder
    name. NB: This Dockerfile is expected to be placed in the parent folder of your app folder (so you should have <i>'app'</i>
    folder and this Dockerfile in the same folder).</p>
  <h3>Step 2: Build an image</h3>
  <p>Ensure that Docker Desktop is running. Open a terminal on your computer and navigate to the
    folder where your app folder and Dockerfile are located. To build an image you will need to run the following
    command: 
    <pre><code><span style="color:#045C64">jovyan@1b6fs2:~/work/path/to/Dockerfile$</span> docker build -t &lt;your-user-name&gt;/&lt;your-app-name&gt; .</code></pre> (NB: do not forget the dot at
    the end of the command). Before you run it, replace <i>&lt;your-user-name&gt;/&lt;your-app-name&gt;</i> with your
    DockerHub username and the name of the app. Building the image may take a while. Once the process is completed, you
    should be able to see the image among your images in the Docker Desktop app.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 3: Upload the Docker image into DockerHub</h3>
  <p>The easiest way to publish an image on DockerHub is to sign in to your account with Docker Desktop and then pick
    "Push to Hub" among the options for your app image. This will publish your image on <i>https://hub.docker.com/r/&lt;your-user-name&gt;/&lt;your-app-name&gt;</i>.
    For example, our example app is available on <a
      href="https://hub.docker.com/r/scilifelabdatacentre/shiny-adhd-medication-sweden">https://hub.docker.com/r/scilifelabdatacentre/shiny-adhd-medication-sweden</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>Step 4: Publish your app on SciLifeLab Serve</h3>
  <p>Now that you built an image and made it available through DockerHub, you can <a href="{% url 'guide_hosting' %}">follow
    our
    general instructions for publishing your R Shiny app on SciLifeLab Serve</a> to make it available for others to see
    and interact with. When creating your app on SciLifeLab Serve, under Docker image you will need to give <i>&lt;your-user-name&gt;/&lt;your-app-name&gt;</i>;
    under path to folder insert <i>/</i> ; under app port insert <i>3838</i>.</p>
