                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>SciLifeLab Serve is a service for model and app deployment that will be offered to life science researchers in Sweden. Currently, the service is in development phase and is accepting pilot users to help with testing and improving functionality. SciLifeLab Serve allows to serve Tensorflow models, PyTorch models, Dash apps, General Python models, and R Shiny apps. The service is available free of charge to researchers in Sweden, both with and without an affiliation SciLifeLab, as well as to SciLifeLab platforms.</p>
                    <p>This work is supported by a grant from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation <a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/">to SciLifeLab for research in Datadriven Life Science</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Infrastructure behind the service</h2>
                    <p>SciLifeLab Serve is developed and maintained by the <a href="https://scilifelab.se/data">SciLifeLab Data Centre</a>. The service is based on the open-source platform <a href="https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/stackn">STACKn</a>, developed by <a href="https://github.com/scaleoutsystems">Scaleout systems</a>, a spinoff from the Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University.</p>
                    <p>It is a cloud native platform that is deployed on Kubernetes cluster managed by the SciLifeLab Data Centre. The platform is vendor agnostic and based on plugin architecture so the list of supported frameworks can be easily extended depending on the demand from the research community. Currently, the platform supports serving of different types of models and apps. TensorFlow models are served using integration with the official TensorFlow Serving docker image. Similarly, PyTorch models are served through a PyTorch Serve docker image that is integrated with the model on the platform. The platform also supports serving of other machine learning models using a FastAPI server. In addition to this, the platform can serve applications built with Dash and R Shiny as well.</p>

                      <h2>Organizations behind the service</h2>
                      <h4>SciLifeLab</h4>
                      <p><a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/">https://www.scilifelab.se</a></p>
                      <p>SciLifeLab, Science for Life Laboratory, is an institution for the advancement of molecular biosciences in Sweden. We are funded as a national research infrastructure by the Swedish government. Our organization leverages the unique strengths of individual researchers across Sweden into a focused resource for the life science community. We provide access for thousands of researchers to the cutting-edge instrumentation and deep scientific expertise necessary to be internationally competitive in bioscience research. This infrastructure is supported and developed by our research community, including internationally recognized experts in life science and technology. Our facilities and expertise create a unique environment for carrying out health and environmental research at the highest level.</p>
                      <p>SciLifeLab started out in 2010 as a joint effort between four universities: Karolinska Institutet, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm University and Uppsala University. Today, we support research activities at all major Swedish universities.</p>
                      <h4>SciLifeLab Data Centre</h4>
                      <p><a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data/">https://www.scilifelab.se/data/</a></p>
                      <p>Life science research is increasingly becoming not only technology-driven, but also data-driven. SciLifeLab coordinates and supports activities throughout the life cycle of data, from project planning, data production, data analysis, data sharing, to publishing and reuse of data, where researchers are dependent on advanced data analysis and e-infrastructures.</p>
                      <p>Our focus is on data arising from the use of SciLifeLab infrastructure platforms, both to promote research on adding value to data, research deriving biological knowledge from data, and infrastructure making data findable and available. At SciLifeLab, we see data as one of the most valuable and long-lasting products of our operations and strive to make our data FAIR, handled according to open science standards and that its long- term value to the scientific community is maximized.</p>
