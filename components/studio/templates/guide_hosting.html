  <h4>Available resources</h4>
  <ul>
    <!-- <li><strong><em>Compute</em>:</strong> a series of components to be used for experimentation and training models with pre-configured data science environments.</li> -->
    <li>R Shiny App</li>
    <li>Dash App</li>
    <li>Tensorflow Serve</li>
    <li>PyTorch Serve</li>
    <li>Python Model Serve (Using FastApi)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Currently, only apps that have been packaged as a
    Docker container and made available on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">DockerHub</a> are
    supported.</p>
  <h4>R Shiny</h4>
  <p>To deploy a R Shiny App click the <span style="font-weight: 500;color: #041c39c7;">'Create'</span> button on the R Shiny App card in the Serve
    Tab. The following information must be set:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Name</em>:</strong> Name of the app, specified by the user (e.g., 'Shiny Example')
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Description</em>:</strong> Provide a brief description of the app.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Subdomain:</em></strong> This is the subdomain that the deployed app will be
      available at (e.g., a subdomain of r46b61563 would mean that the app would be available
      at r46b61563.serve.scilifelab.se). If no subdomain name is entered, a random name will
      be genrated by default. By clicking on <b>New</b> you can specify the custom subdomain
      name of your choice (provided that it is not
      already taken).
      This subdomain will then appear in the Subdomain options and the subdomain will appear
      in the format 'name-you-chose.serve.scilifelab.se'.
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Permissions</em>:</strong> The permissions for the project. There are 3 levels of
      permissions for an app:
      <ul>
        <li><strong><em>Private</em>:</strong> The app can only be accessed by the user that created
          the app. (Sign
          In required)
        </li>
        <li><strong><em>Project</em>:</strong> All members of the project will be able to access the
          app. (Sign In
          required)
        </li>
        <li><strong><em>Public</em>:</strong> Anyone with the URL can access the app.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Path to folder</em>:</strong> This is the path to the folder (inside the docker
      container) in which
      the main Shiny application file is located (usually app.R).
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>App Port</em>:</strong> The port that the Shiny server runs on (usually 3838).</li>
    <li><strong><em>DockerHub Image</em>:</strong> Name of the image on DockerHub.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you deploy your app, you'll be taken to the serve page again, and should see your app in
    a list on the top of the screen. The state will initially show as 'Pending' (shown in an
    orange label), but should change to 'Running' (shown in a green label)</p>

  <p>To update a Shiny App after a new image has been published on DockerHub, click the pencil
    icon next to the app and press on the <span style="font-weight: 500;color: #041c39c7;">'Update'</span> button on the bottom of the form. To
    delete the app, press the bin icon beside the pencil icon.</p>

  <h4>Dash</h4>
  <p>To deploy a Dash App click the <span style="font-weight: 500;color: #041c39c7;">'Create'</span> button on the R Shiny App card in the Serve
    Tab. The following information must be set:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Name</em>:</strong> Name of the app, specified by the user (e.g., 'Dash Example')
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Description</em>:</strong> Provide a brief description of the app.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Subdomain</em>:</strong> This is the subdomain that the deployed app will be
      available at (e.g., a subdomain of r46b61563 would mean that the app would be available
      at r46b61563.serve.scilifelab.se). If no subdomain name is entered, a random name will
      be genrated by default. By clicking on <b>New</b> you can specify the custom subdomain

    <li><strong><em>Path to folder</em>:</strong> This is the path to the folder (inside the docker
      container) in which
      the main Dash application file is located (usually app.py).
    </li>
