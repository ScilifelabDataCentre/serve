                        <p>Projects are spaces where users are able to create apps and models. Created projects can be
                            found under the
                            tab <span style="font-weight: 500;color: #041c39c7;">Projects</span> in the sidebar. This
                            tab contains all
                            projects that you have created or have been granted access to.

                                instance available
                                for the user. Using this instance, users can e.g can run experiments and also create
                                model objects
                                mentioned above. The tutorials below will elaborate on this.)</li>

                        <p>This tutorial is intended as a quick example to get started with working on ML model
                            deployment and serving using Scilifelab Serve.</p>
                        <p> When a project is created, users also get a jupyter lab instance. This can be found in the
                            Serve tab on the Sidebar (which is visible when you open a project). Click on open to go to
                            the Jupyter Lab instance. On the home screen, click on Terminal. This will open a terminal
                            tab inside the jupyter lab. Clone the tutorials repository <a
                                href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/serve-tutorials">serve-tutorials</a>. You
                            will now see the <code>serve-tutorials</code> folder.</p>
                        <h3 id="tensorflow">Tensorflow</h3>
                        <p>Go to <code>serve-tutorials/Tensorflow/AML</code> folder. Open the <code>aml.ipynb</code>
                            notebook file. This notebook contains the code to create a ML Model and save it as an object
                            on Scilifelab Serve. Run all the cells in the notebook. This may take some time (around 20
                            mins) as the model is trained.</p>

                        <p>After running this file, go to the Serve tab on the portal and create a Tensorflow Serve App
                            with the follwing entries:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Name: </strong>AML Tensorflow</li>
                            <li><strong>Subdomain: </strong> This is automatically generated. </li>
                            <li><strong>Permissions: </strong> Set the permission to project.</li>
                            <!-- <li><strong>Persistent Volume:</strong> The volume that needs to be attached to the instance.</li> -->
                            <li><strong>Model: </strong>Select the model, in this case the model is named aml.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flavor: </strong> This indicates the resources given to the app. Currently on
                                the Medium option is availble on the platform.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This should create the app and it will be visible in the Serve Tab. Copy the link for the
                            service (you can do this by right clicking open and selecting copy link address). Then, go
                            back to the jupyter lab instacne and open the <code>predict.ipynb</code> notebook. Replace
                            the endpoint with the url that you copied. Run the cells in the notebook. If you see a
                            prediction, this means that the service is running successfully.</p>

                        <p>To serve a pytroch model, we will use a pytorch model archive (VGG11) already prepared. You
                            can read more about the model <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>Go to the <code>project-vol</code> folder inside the jupyter lab. Right-click to create a new
                            folder and give it a name (e.g pytorch-deployment). Go to the terminal (you can also launch
                            a new terminal through <code>File > New > Terminal</code>). Change directory to the newly
                            created folder, so in this case by <code>cd project-vol/pytorch-deployment/</code>. Once
                            inside this folder run the command
                            <code>curl -O -J https://nextcloud.dckube.scilifelab.se/s/TSNxFJCYrpJZAnz/download</code>.
                            This will download the <code>vgg11_scripted.mar</code> archive to this folder. Now that we
                            have the model archive, we need to launch the Pytorch Serve App. On the Scilifelab Serve
                            portal, go to the Serve tab. Then create the Pytorch Serve App with the following values:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Name: </strong>VGG11 Serve</li>
                            <li><strong>Subdomain: </strong> This is automatically generated, if not selected. You can
                                create a subdomain to choose using the Add Subdomain form located at the bottom.</li>
                            <li><strong>Permissions: </strong> Set the permission to public. (Currently, public
                                permissions are required to access the serve url for pytorch apps).</li>
                            <li><strong>Flavor: </strong> This indicates the resources given to the app. Currently on
                                the Medium option is availble on the platform.</li>
                            <li><strong>Persistent Volume:</strong> The volume that needs to be attached to the
                                instance. In this case it is important to select project-vol as that is where we
                                dowloaded the vgg11_scripted.mar file.</li>
                            <li><strong>Path to Model Store:</strong> This is the path to the folder where the model is
                                located (relative to the mounted volume). As the model was downloaded in the
                                pytorch-deployment folder inside the project-vol, the value for this will be
                                pytorch-deployment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Comma-separeted list of models (model1,model2,model3): </strong> This can be
                                left empty. Here, model names from the model archive can be listed to deploy only those
                                models.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Create the app and wait for the status to turn to <code>Running</code>. Right click on open
                            and copy the link address for the app. To check if it is working properly you can go to the
                            jupyter lab instance and open the terminal. Go to the <code>serve-tutorials/PyTorch/</code>
                            folder using <code>cd serve-tutorials/PyTorch/</code> and run the command
                            <code>curl copied-url/vgg11_scripted -T kitten.jpg</code> (inplace of copied-url add the url
                            you copied earlier). You should get a json response if the deployment is working properly.

                        <h3 id="python-deploy">Python Model Deployment</h3>
                        <p>Launch a new terminal from within your Jupyter instance and go to the Python-Model-Deployment folder:</p>
                        <p> <code>cd serve-tutorials/Python-Model-Deployment folder</code></p>
                        <p>Install the pip requirements:</p>
                        <p><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></p>
                        <p>Now you should be ready to open the <code>getting_started_with_swebert.ipynb</code>in the <em>notebooks</em> folder. Please follow the notebook's instructions.</p>
                        <p>Once you have run all the cells in the above notebook, open up again the terminal and execute the following commands within the repository directory (inside the Python-Model-Deployment folder):</p>
                        <p><code>stackn create object afbert -r minor</code></p>
                        <p><code>stackn get objects</code></p>
                        <p>(Check that the model is listed; you should be able to see the newly created model object in
                            your Scilifelab Serve UI, under the "<em>Objects</em>" tab)</p>

                        <p>Deploy the newly created model object with the "<em>Python Model Deployment</em>" component (under the "<em>Serve</em>" tab). <em>Name</em> can be anything, <em>Model</em> should match the name of the newly created model (e.g. "afbert:v0.1.0"); leave the rest as defaults.</p>
                        <p> <strong>Note:</strong> It could take some time for this model to initialize, so keep checking the logs until it is available and wait until it is running successfully.</p>
                        <p>Once the above serving app is up and running, copy the endpoint URL by right-clicking on the <em>Open</em> link.</p>
                        <p>Go back to your Jupyter Lab and open the <code>predict.ipynb</code> notebook under the <em>notebooks</em> folder. Paste the copied URL in place of the url in order to use the correct endpoint for the prediction.</p>
                        <p>It is time to test the prediction! Run all the cells and check the results.</p>
                        <p>You can play around by changing the values of the <code>example</code> and <code>msk_ind</code> variables. The latter will mask (or "hide") one of the words in the example sentence; then the prediction will shown the possible candidates for such "missing" word.</p>
