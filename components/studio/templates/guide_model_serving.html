<p>These tutorials are intended as quick examples to get started with working on ML model
  deployment and serving using Scilifelab Serve.</p>

<h4>Available resources</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tensorflow Serve</li>
<li>PyTorch Serve</li>
<li>Python Model Serve (Using FastApi)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Getting started</h4>
  
  <p>When a project is created, users also get a JupyterLab instance. This can be found in the
    Compute tab on the Sidebar (visible when you open a project). </p>
  <ol>
    <li> Click on <span style="font-weight: 500;color: #041c39c7;">'Open'</span> to go to the JupyterLab instance. </li>
    <li>On the home screen, click on <span style="font-weight: 500;color: #041c39c7;">'Terminal'</span> to open a terminal tab. </li> 
    <li>Clone the tutorials repository <a href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/serve-tutorials">serve-tutorials</a>. 
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure you have git installed.</li>
          <li>Run <code>git clone https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/serve-tutorials</code> in the terminal.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> This creates a folder called <code>serve-tutorials</code> which contains necessary files for the remaining tutorial.</li>
    <li> Continue to either <a href="#tensorflow">Tensorflow serving</a>, <a href="#pytorch">PyTorch Serve.</a> or <a href="#pytorch">Python Model Serve.</a></li>
  </ol>

  <h4 id="tensorflow">Tensorflow</h4>
  <p>Go to <code>serve-tutorials/Tensorflow/AML</code> folder. Open the <code>aml.ipynb</code>
    notebook file. This notebook contains the code to create a ML Model and save it as an object
    on Scilifelab Serve. Run all the cells in the notebook. This may take some time (around 20
    mins) as the model is trained.</p>

  <p>After running this file, go to the Serve tab on the portal and create a Tensorflow Serve App
    with the follwing entries:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Name</em>:</strong> AML Tensorflow</li>
    <li><strong><em>Subdomain</em>:</strong> This is automatically generated. A custom subdomain can be
      created by filling out the form below ("Add Subdomain"), this domain will then show up
      as an option.
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Permissions</em>:</strong> Set the permission to project.</li>
    <!-- <li><strong>Persistent Volume:</strong> The volume that needs to be attached to the instance.</li> -->
    <li><strong><em>Model</em>:</strong> Select the model, in this case the model is named aml.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Flavor</em>:</strong> This indicates the resources given to the app. Currently on
      the Medium option is availble on the platform.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>This should create the app and it will be visible in the Serve Tab. Copy the link for the
    service (you can do this by right clicking Open and selecting copy link address). Then, go
    back to the JupyterLab instance and open the <code>predict.ipynb</code> notebook. Replace
    the endpoint with the URL that you copied. Run the cells in the notebook. If you see a
    prediction, this means that the service is running successfully.</p>

  <h4 id="pytorch">PyTorch Serve</h4>
  <p>To serve a PyTorch model, we will use a pytorch model archive (VGG11) already prepared. You
    can read more about the model <a
      href="https://serve-dev.scilifelab.se/https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Go to the <code>project-vol</code> folder inside the JupyterLab. Right-click to create a new
    folder and give it a name (e.g., pytorch-deployment). Go to the terminal (you can also
    launch
    a new terminal through <code>File > New > Terminal</code>). Change directory to the newly
    created folder, so in this case by <code>cd project-vol/pytorch-deployment/</code>. Once
    inside this folder run the command
    <code>curl -O -J https://nextcloud.dckube.scilifelab.se/s/TSNxFJCYrpJZAnz/download</code>.
    This will download the <code>vgg11_scripted.mar</code> archive to this folder. Now that we
    have the model archive, we need to launch the Pytorch Serve App. On the Scilifelab Serve
    portal, go to the Serve tab. Then create the Pytorch Serve App with the following values:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Name</em>:</strong> VGG11 Serve</li>
    <li><strong><em>Subdomain</em></strong> This is automatically generated, if not selected. You can
      create a subdomain to choose using the Add Subdomain form located at the bottom.
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Permissions</em>:</strong> Set the permission to public. (Currently, public
      permissions are required to access the serve URL for pytorch apps).
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Flavor</em>:</strong> This indicates the resources given to the app. Currently on
      the Medium option is availble on the platform.
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Persistent Volume</em>:</strong> The volume that needs to be attached to the
      instance. In this case it is important to select project-vol as that is where we
      dowloaded the vgg11_scripted.mar file.
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Path to Model Store</em>:</strong> This is the path to the folder where the model is
      located (relative to the mounted volume). As the model was downloaded in the
      pytorch-deployment folder inside the project-vol, the value for this will be
      pytorch-deployment.
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Comma-separeted list of models (model1,model2,model3)</em>:</strong> This can be
      left empty. Here, model names from the model archive can be listed to deploy only those
      models.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Create the app and wait for the status to turn to <code>Running</code>. Right click on Open
    and copy the link address for the app. To check if it is working properly you can go to the
    JupyterLab instance and open the terminal. Go to the <code>serve-tutorials/PyTorch/</code>
    folder using <code>cd serve-tutorials/PyTorch/</code> and run the command
    <code>curl copied-url/vgg11_scripted -T kitten.jpg</code> (inplace of copied-url add the URL
    you copied earlier). You should get a JSON response if the deployment is working properly.
  </p>

  <h3 id="python-deploy">Python Model Deployment</h3>
  <p>Launch a new terminal from within your JupyterLab instance and go to the Python-Model-Deployment
    folder:</p>
  <p><code>cd serve-tutorials/Python-Model-Deployment folder</code></p>
  <p>Install the required packages:</p>
  <p><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></p>
  <p>Go to <code>serve-tutorials/Python-Model-Deployment</code> folder. Open the
    <code> getting_started_with_swebert.ipynb</code>
    notebook file. Follow the notebook's instructions.</p>
  <p>Once you have run all the cells in the above notebook, open up again the terminal and execute
    the following commands within the repository directory (inside the Python-Model-Deployment
    folder):</p>
  <p><code>stackn create object afbert -r minor</code></p>
  <p><code>stackn get objects</code></p>
  <p>(Check that the model is listed; you should be able to see the newly created model object in
    your Scilifelab Serve UI, under the "<em>Objects</em>" tab)</p>

  <p>Deploy the newly created model object with the "<em>Python Model Deployment</em>" component
    (under the "<em>Serve</em>" tab). <em>Name</em> can be anything, <em>Model</em> should match
    the name of the newly created model (e.g., "afbert:v0.1.0"); leave the rest as defaults.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> It could take some time for this model to initialize, so keep
    checking the logs until it is available and wait until it is running successfully.</p>
  <p>Once the above serving app is up and running, copy the endpoint URL by right-clicking on the
    <em>Open</em> link.</p>
  <p>Go back to your JupyterLab and open the <code>predict.ipynb</code> notebook under the
    <em>notebooks</em> folder. Paste the copied URL in place of the URL in order to use the
    correct endpoint for the prediction.</p>
  <p>It is time to test the prediction! Run all the cells and check the results.</p>
  <p>You can play around by changing the values of the <code>example</code> and
    <code>msk_ind</code> variables. The latter will mask (or "hide") one of the words in the
    example sentence; then the prediction will shown the possible candidates for such "missing"
    word.</p>
